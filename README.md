# colorful-popping-circles

```
The code generates 40 circles with random x and y values between 1 and 500, 
fill each circle with a random color, 
and display each circle for a quarter of a second before hiding it and displaying the next one:
```

>This code creates a 2D graphics context on an HTML canvas element with the ID myCanvas.

`const canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");`  
  - >retrieves the canvas element from the HTML document using its ID.

`const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");`  
  - >creates a 2D rendering context for the canvas.

`const randomColor = () => '#' + Math.floor(Math.random() * 16777215).toString(16);`  
  - >defines a function randomColor that generates a random color in hexadecimal format.

`const drawCircle = (x, y) => { ... }`  
  - >defines a function drawCircle that takes x and y as arguments and draws a circle at the given x and y coordinate on the canvas. The circle has a radius of 20 and is filled with a random color generated by the randomColor function.

`const displayCircles = () => { ... }`  
  - >defines a function displayCircles that loops 40 times, with each iteration calling drawCircle with random x and y values. The setTimeout function is used to call drawCircle with a delay of 250 milliseconds times the iteration count.

Finally, `displayCircles();`  
  - >invokes the displayCircles function to display 40 circles with random positions and colors on the canvas.
